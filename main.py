Make sure you know some stuff about that location!\n-If you stay in a continent for too long, you will automatically move to a different one and answer a question about the new continent.\n-You can pick easy, medium, or hard questions to answer.\n-To get farther away from the police you must answer the trivia questions quickly and accurately. \n-You have three lives, and you can lose them by getting a question wrong. If you lose all three, you get a bonus question to revive your three lives. If you answer correctly, keep going. However, if you answer incorrectly, the police will catch you and you lose. Game over.\n-The way to win the game is to make it to the end without dying at all in Easy mode, without dying twice in Medium mode, and without dying thrice in Hard mode. \nGood Luck!"
